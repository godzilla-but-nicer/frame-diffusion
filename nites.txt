public partisanship bayes method from great lakes

how can we show that public independent from other groups or not

does the republican party look more like trump over time

how do we look at group changes over time, are right wing journos and politicians becoming more or less similar in framing

# stuff to do

1. probablility that a frame is used on both half of dyads
2. three graphs one for retweet, one for quote, one for reply, dyadic co-occurance
3. framing effects linking production and consumption. how much predictability is left after conditioning on user's frame consumption?
4. how do we combine the earlier work with this dyad stuff?
5. how often are a users frames being amplified vs countered?
6. make a big planning document to present next week. what kinds of analyses can we do/should we do etc.
    - include everything for the whole project
7. send availability for next week

## Granger Causality problems

- The residual time series are not identical length
  - The time series are being aligned in some arbitrary way for granger causality tests
  - could be underestimating effects as we are sort of already purturbing the time series
- Conditional package in R gives weird output
  - No clear single metric descriing strength or liklihood of granger causal relationship
  - very slow!
  - could we use the events in determining the residuals and then just run regular granger causality?
- I should read some of the papers I downloaded on this to see if I can make sense of it
